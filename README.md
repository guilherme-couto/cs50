MeAjudaAqui

Have you ever had to buy a book or sign up for a test, but you didn't have enough money?
Or, who knows, you already had a financial emergency and were unable to take that course you wanted so much. Result: frustrations.

Wouldn't it be nice to have someone close who could help you at these times? Would be great.
But, what if there is no one there at the time? MeAjudaAqui intends to increase your options.
We no longer want anyone giving up on something because they don't have enough money.

And how it works? It's simple. You register on the platform, either to help or to be helped.
Then, you click on "Novo Pedido" (New Request) and provide some information about it, such as price, deadline and a brief description.
Your request goes to the "Quadro" (Board) tab of the website and anyone from Brazil (or the world) can help you.

Now, how do I help? It is even simpler. Just write down the number of any request that you really want to help and put it in the "Ajudar" (Help) tab.
When doing this, we will give you the number and email of the person who placed the request.
It will be up to you to contact the person to arrange the payment details and, who knows, even make a new friend.

MeAjudaAqui is a platform to financially assist people in the little things of everyday life. Quick and practical thing, from one to one.
We believe in people and in the microrevolutions that the relationship between them can make. Do you?
